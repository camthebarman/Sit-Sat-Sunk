/* demo.js — a busy Friday night, roughly 7:45 service.

   Times are relative to whenever this is loaded, so every seat timer and wait
   is live rather than frozen at the minute the data was written. Applied over
   the tables already on the floor, so a room arranged to match the real Harbor
   Hotel keeps its layout — only statuses, counts, notes and the waitlist are
   replaced. */
